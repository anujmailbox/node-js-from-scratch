# Node.js from Scratch

Node.js is an amazing platform. It is the V8 JavaScript that Google Chrome uses on the front end running on a server. As a developer who loves JavaScript in the browser, it is amazing to be able to write web servers and other programs in the very same language. As you'll see, it isn't too different from JS in the browser; however, it isn't all the same, either; there are plenty of patterns and features that we'll cover in this course.

This repository contains the examples that were built in each lesson.
